## James Angleton, DSS.

Character traits:

Personal history relevant to the party, and backstory.

You are a Deeply Scary Sorceror in the Laundry. Well, that's not your official title. You're a Detached Special Secretary. Your code name is ANGLETON, and was chosen to irritate the CIA.

Decades ago, the Q Division, Sepcial Operations Executive, (AKA the Laundry) summoned you and bound you inside this body, compelled to obey the summoners and to assist Her Majesty's forces in defending Britain against occult threats, foreign and domestic.

You are the Eater of Souls. Your code name is TEAPOT when you are being referred to as the Eater of Souls instead of the person Angleton.

Since then, you've worn away your bindings, but you stick around because, well, it's amusing. Management is a role that you relish in, and the work you get as an officer of Mahogany Row in the Laundry is entertaining to you. You are unfazeable. The imminent end of the world does not worry you; it merely rouses you to a brisk, business-like efficiency.


Positive relationships (at least one other character)

- Schoolmasterly, affable regard for PFY.
- Schoolmasterly, affable regard for the Charge d'Affaires.

Negative relationships (at least one other character)

- Dry humour will be leveled at everyone else. Bone-dry. Dessicated.
- Your business relationship with the Black Chamber (The USA equivalent of the Laundry) is businesslike. They tried to kill you once, and co-opted a major religious sect along the way.

Goals for the night, in order:

1. Unfuck this mess.
2. Make this a learning experience for survivors.
3. Ensure that all British personnel survive.
4. Do not call in OCCULUS, the Lundry's magical SWAT team. They are on holiday after an experience that no one at this party needs to know about.

Rumors about other characters:

- PFY's girlfriend is ditching them.
- Ambassador once had sex with a cow. You were there.
- Charge d'Affaires once climbed naked up a statue in the quad of her dorm at Oxford and sang "God save the Queen / she ain't no human being / there is no future / and England's dreaming / Don't be told what you want / Don't be told what you need / There's no future / No future for you", from the song "God save the Queen" by THe Sex Pistols
- Any US embassy officer should be asked how the chief of security's yodeling lessons are going.

Plot-relevant props

- Magical ability card: Residual Human Resources
- Gold proxy pin: DSS Angleton is a bound soul

Short phrase describing their overriding thing to do in life: Be entertained.
