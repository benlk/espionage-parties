## Sarah/Sam Connor

Character traits:

You're a bright, famous, established Artificial Intelligence ethics researcher, with dozens of papers under your belt. Who are you kidding - your AI career was derailed in sophomore year when a journalism elective metastasized into a journalism career. Politics reporting pays the bills.
You're a member of Dare Club, a daring club of adventurous people that's become quite the fad. When Dare Club members meet, they give each other sensible dares, and accept no new dares until they've completed the dare they received. They can dare other Dare Club members while dared, though.
