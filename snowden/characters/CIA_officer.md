Character traits:

Personal history relevant to the party, and backstory.

Seven years ago, you got ensared by the Black Chamber. You used a minor magic to gut a deer you had killed on a hunting trip, and set off alarms at a nearby American magical facility. You knew too much. You were transferred from your position as a low-level CIA analyst to a position as a low-level operative for the Black Chamber, keeping your analyst job as cover. Five years ago, you were posted to the American Embassy in the UK as part of the CIA station there, but also as a magical observer to determine whether a larger American magical presence would be needed at the Embassy. You've encountered your opposite numbers in the British magical service, "the Laundry", but don't often run into each other. The American Embassy is a quiet place.
