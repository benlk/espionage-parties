## Pat Foxtrot Young

Character traits:

- You used to be inquisitive, curious, creative. You were making a crowdfunded 3D shooter game, developing it from te comfort of your flat in Islington while whiling the hours away in a civil-service job denying pensioners benefits because they weren't looknig for work. (You don't like the Tory government, let's put it that way.) You tested a new rendering algorithm you wrote, hoping it would speed up particle effect display. Particle effects were sped up - your neighborhood was filled with a poisonous gas that converted its victims to zombies.

Personal history relevant to the party, and backstory.

- Attended American university with VP

Positive relationships (at least one other character)

- You're madly in love with someone you've started dating recently. She's everything to you.

Negative relationships (at least one other character)

- Deep distaste for zombies.
- Awe of DSS Angleton, who is like twelve levels above you in the org chart.
- Awe/Fear of the Auditors, who you suspect actually run the Laundry.

Goals for the night:

- Something feels off about the party. Find out what's supsicious.
- Find out if any people in the party work for the Black Chamber (The American magical agency) or the Laundry.
- Don't piss off the Americans.
- Make friends with American embassy personnel and the press.

Rumors about other characters:

- The Forecasting Office wants you at this party. You don't know why. They're the Laundry's future-seers, and sometimes they don't exist, but when they have a forecast, everyone jumps to respond. For this reason, you were issued with the Proxy Pins.
- Two of the bodyguards at the embassy are dating?
- Someone in the American embassy is a magic-user.
- At least one of the press here are American counter-intelligence spies.
