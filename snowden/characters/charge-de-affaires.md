## Jamie Richards (Charge d' Affaires in the American Embassy)

Character traits:

You're friends with everyone you ever meet. You want everyone to be friends with everyone elese, if possible, but for now you'll settle with everyone being friends with you, including your friend the Vice President, who's starting his campaign for the next Presidency. Other people you've been friends with are Political reporter 2, who has always been your friend.

Also somewhere you ran across a grimoire describing certain occult acts that you were surprised to find out work as described. 

Personal history relevant to the party, and backstory.

Positive relationships (at least one other character)

- secretly sleeping with bodyguard, who's cute.
- You're supportive of your friend the Ambassador, but you do want his job. Unfortunately you're in the civil service and he's a political appointee, so you're really going to have to shine. Perhaps there's a magical way to do this.

Negative relationships (at least one other character)

- Anyone who'll get in the way of your goal of becoming the US Ambassador to the UK
- No, seriously, you're friends to everyone.

Goals for the night:

- use the containment ward in the basement to summon a demon, to power the geas that will make all party attendes back your ambassadorship: follow the instructions in the grimoire.
- Catch up with everyone. Maintain friendliness.
- Don't let people leave the party before the geas is set.
