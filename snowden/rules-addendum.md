# Rules addendum

Players' cellphones are in play in this game. If you do not want your cellphone to be in play during this game, we'll have a secure storage area for them.

Things written on paper attached to the windows *are what is going on outside that window*. Do not change what is written on a window unless your character mechanics allow for it.

Don't mess with computer hardware unless it's marked as game-involved.
