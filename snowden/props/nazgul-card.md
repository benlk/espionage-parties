# Nazgul card

At any time, you can summon one of the Nine Nazgul - the most-powerful members of the Black Chamber. They are incredibly powerful. They're incredibly vicious. Summoning a Nazgul will not save your life; the Nazgul incarnates in your body and you die.

You die.

Got that?

If you summon the Nazgul, you're dead. There's no resurrection.

And if you do it, that Nazgul is probably going to kill everyone nearby, because that's how the Nazgul operate.

You don't want to summon the Nazgul unless it's a situation of last resort, like if OCCULUS is about to storm an American embassy property. It's going to cause a diplomatic incident if an American goes around killing large numbers of Brits.

**Meta**: Tell the GM if you're gonna use this.

## Nazgul

Single describing word: Ruthless

Goals:
- Eliminate threats to the United States by whatever means necessary, as quickly as possible.
- Maybe don't annoy the Laundry; you're on their turf.
- Definitely do taunt Angleton about the vampire that broke into the Dansey House HQ and put a geas up in there to convince people that vampires didn't exist.

Knowledge: You know everything that the person you assumed control of knew. Plus, you're a top-noth ritual magician.
