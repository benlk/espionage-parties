# Proxy Pins

Proxy Pins allow people to continue living while having had their soul stolen. Removing the Proxy Pin kills someone.

The PFY and the Charge d'Affaires are issued with Proxy Pins at the beginning of the game, which have slightly different mechanics.

## The Laundry Proxy Pins

- silver, three small and one large
- must be wearing the large for small ones to be active; removing the large one kills small-pin wearers when they notice that she has removed it

Note to wearers:

> Hi! You just lost the last 5 minutes of your memory. You do not notice the addition of a lapel pin to your wardrobe. Give the bearer of this card your yellow foam ball.
> You cannot read or interact with red-soul or blue-soul items, but you can see them. Act as if you have a green soul.
> If the lapel pin is removed from you, you die.
> If you notice that the large silver lapel pin is removed from the person who gave you this card, you're dead.

## The Charge d'Affaires' proxy pins

- Copper, three large
- Not controlled by a central pin
- Return to the PFY once the wearer dies
- Wearers are more likely to obey the PFY
