## Setting

- The non-plot bits:
	- What's the time period/history/world/etc? (Write a resources page for the players!)
	- Where is the event? What qualities does the venue have? What resources are available to attendees? (Include this stuff in the resources page!)

- The plot bits:
	- Premise: Why are people coming here?

- The meta-plot bits:
	- Why won't people leave the venue?

## Characters

- The non-plot bits:
	- What do characters know about the setting? How has the state of the world impacted their lives?
	- What is their background?
	- What is their person? (Feel free to leave this as vague as possible; the player can supply their own gender/sexuality/body type.)

- The plot bits:
	- Why are they at the event?
	- What are their goals for the night?
	- What do they have access to that other characters don't? Examples include knowledge of the venue, keys, knives, guns, bottles of elven liquor, magic googles and so on.
