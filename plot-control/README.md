## Plot Control Cards

Magical abilities are granted through the use of "Plot Control" cards, each carefully stamped, which tell the subject of the magic what the magic does and how they are to respond.

Some people have the ability to resist Plot Control, and when they do so they must tell the controller that they're emitting a faint orange glow. This could be done with hats or scarves, for example, for people who always emit an orange glow. Maybe another color could be used.

Some Plot Control cards are Simon Says, and work against anti-magical people.

Some people on each side of the controller-not-conroller side wonder what there is about these cards that makes them magical.
