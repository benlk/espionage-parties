## Pok&eacute;mon mechanics

Every Pok&eacute;mon in the game will be represented by a Pok&eacute;mon card. Pok&eacute;mon may be hidden on the body of their trainers or in other places. In order to use a Pok&eacute;mon's abilities, the trainer must draw the card and hold the card out in front of them. If a card indicates that a Pok&eacute;mon's ability requires energy, the trainer must have that many energy cards available to them before using that ability.

Pok&eacute;mon may have supplemental abilities provided on sticky notes attached to the card. Do not remove these sticky notes from the card.

Pok&eacute;mon may have character traits or reactions listed on these notes. Act in response to how the Pok&eacute;mon behave.

Energy cards may be provided to characters, and will be secreted around the game area.

Eggs will be represented by plastic Easter eggs. Eggs will not hatch during the party, no matter how many steps you walk.
