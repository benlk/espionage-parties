# Organizer

Here's a list of what you'll need to do:

1. Create a setting
2. Create a lot of character sheets
3. Create a general rules sheet
4. Find a venue
5. Acquire props as needed
6. Distribute the info sheets to players before the party, and answer player questions about their characters
7. Arrive early, set up props
8. Answer last-minute character questions and distribute props
9. Introduce all the players to each other's characters (if appropriate)
10. Run the game
11. Start the recap session
12. Ask for feedback

90% of your work is before the event actually starts.

## The setting

Settings can be anything you want, but in general you'll need:

- a time period
- a general feel for costumes
- a history of the world as relevant to your party and your characters

Example settings:

- 1930s mill town, where the mill owner's factory has suffered a collapse and some workers have died. He's hosting a dinner party to discuss financing repairs, and possibly additional business opportunities.
- 1950s politician's house, where the Senator will announce his campaign for reelection
- The 13th peace summit of a magical WWI, hosted in neutral territory by a powerful mage, with attending delegations from the major and minor powers of each nonmagical side and the neutral mage's guild.
- The vault party of a crazed millionaire, who brought all his friends and yes-men underground before WWIII. It's now 30 years past Doomsday.

## Character sheets

Every player will need a character, and you'll need additional character sheets for players whose characters die during the course of the party.

Every character will need:

- A name
- Character traits: happy, melancholic, in love, desperate, drunk, PTSD, arrogant, sheeple, get along with everyone, etc.
- Relevant personal history and backstory
- Positive relationships with at least one other character (They set you up with your current spouse, they saved everyone's lives, he's a hoopy frood who knows where his towel is, she's kind to animals, and so on.)
- Negative relationships with at least one other character (He killed your wife, she prevented a business juncture, you were raised by robots and they really don't like robots, and so forth.)
- Goals to accomplish over the course of the night (Have sex, establish a business deal with Mr. Mosby, find out what happened to your cousin, kill the Empress, end war, discover what your magical artifact does, steal three people's badges, drink some of the Goblin Queen's wine, etc.)
- Rumors and knowledge about other characters (to include other characters' backstories and props, if appropriate)

Optional things:

- Any notable plot-relevant props they have, such as money, weapons, poisons, antidotes, magical artefacts, etc.
- A Drive, a short phrase that is their overriding thing to do in life: Games, Truth, Loyalty, Justice, Greed, etc.

You (The game-master's) character will probably be one of the support staff for the event, such as the host, the butler, or the maid. In any case, the game-runner's character is not one of the main characters of the event's plots. You may end up taking a lot of time out of character to work on keeping the party moving, such as answering plot questions, determining whether people have successfully picpocketed, bringing dead people into the game with new characters, etc.

## General rules

Most espionage parties follow the following rules:

- Guns/Knives: A single hit by a dart or weapon to the head or chest is immediately lethal, and a close-range shot (within 4 feet) to the stomach is, as well.A second shot to the stomach from any range is lethal. A single shot to another part of the body will cause the character to drop whatever he or she is holding (if a gun, the character may fire one immediate shot before dropping it). A single shot to an extremity will not be lethal but will result in difficulties (i.e. limping if a leg). Darts that do not make contact with the target will be treated as misses. Once fired, a dart may not be re-used during the game. Ammunition is limited.
- Poison: poison can be injected. Poison will be represented by colored stickers, which are applied to skin or clothing.  After ten seconds, the poisoner can remove the sticker. Either the poisoner or ____ will inform you of the effects.
- Poison: poison is a powder that can be added to drinks or food. The poisoner will tell ____, who will inform the victim (if any) of any effects.
- Death: If you die in the course of the game, please lie still until your body has been found. If you are not found within five minutes, you may simply inform ____. Unless you die at the end of the night, you will likely receive a secondary character of lesser complexity, but still featuring at least one secret and objective. Please practice good role-playing and separate your previous character’s knowledge from that of the new one.
- Sex: Sex and seduction are traditional features in an espionage toolset. Whether to meet a character’s personal objectives, as a distraction, as a bribe or for the hell of it, sexy times happen. To engage in intercourse, two players must hold hands and count to thirty aloud. Anyone finding them during this time will catch them in the “act.”
- Out-of-character actions: If you need to do something that is not in character or not visible (check your phone, ask ____ a question, teleport someplace, be magically invisible), raise one hand to the side of your head with the fingers extended: "Half-moose". If you see someone making the half-moose sign, your character doesn't see them or know what they're doing.

If you're going to add a mechanic to the game such as magic or mana, you'll have to write those rules yourself. One out of eight games that I'm aware of has had magic in it, and it went okay.

## Venues

Houses are great for this. Apartments are eeeh. You'll want there to be parking nearby for your guests.

Your venue will need at least:

- 1 room with a door that can be closed
- 1 bathroom
- 1 general living area
- 1 dining area (for light snacks and drinks)

The fanciest venue of my 4 games had the following areas in play:

- 2 general living areas
- 1 kitchen for snacks
- 4 bedrooms on 2 levels
- 2 bathrooms
- 1 basement
- 1 porch

## Props

These change depending on the characters and the setting and other rules in play.

- Guns: Nerf.
- Knives: Made of paper.
- Swords: Foam, unless you trust your players.
- Poisons: pieces of paper, stickers, sugar packets.

Bonus materials, dependent upon the plot:

- Books: diaries, journals, spellbooks, technical reports, personal memoirs
- Potion ingredients, puzzle pieces, magical artifacts, badges controlling access to areas of the venue, goggles letting people see magic, mind-control things, and so on
- Political favors made physical with playing cards
- Money

## Distribution of sheets and info

Everybody gets their first character a while ahead of time, so they can learn their character. Aim for 2 weeks. At the same time, send them the general info sheet and the rules. Discourage communication between players about characters ("meta-gaming") unless it's appropriate communication between their characters. Examples would be two characters that are members of a political delegation arranging things.

Be prepared to answer questions.

## Setup

- snacks
- light drinks (alcohol has never been a good idea here)
- hide things that need to be hidden
- label closets and drawers that are in-game with something, such as strips of green fabric
- have player info sheets, money and props set aside for when they arrive.

## The event

At the beginning, call players to a closed room and give them their props. Ask them if they have any last questions.

Once all players have arrived, ave them introduce their characters to each other, if it's expected that they would know each other already (if they've been living together underground for years) or if it's a situation where they would be introduced to each other (a diplomatic conference). Otherwise, let them introduce themselves to each other.

Characters do their things. As gamr-runner, you will want to be participating as a character, but also keeping an eye out for dead people and people who aren't interacting. If a character dies and the party's not yet over, give them a new character sheet and (if appropriate) introduce them to the party.

You will probably spend a good part of the game under a half-moose. 

## The recap

Every player tells what their character(s) did during the course of the party and what went through their heads. Do this in whatever order you like.

## Feedback and the next party

If you're planning on running this exact scenario again, you might want to make changes to the character sheets to correct player-identified deficiencies. If not, think about the next event you might run.
