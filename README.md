## Intro: What is an Espionage Party?

An espionage party is a social event where every participant acts out a character. 

Espionage parties are the brainchild of Rey Miranti and Kyle Kissel, without whom we would have only masquerade balls and Humans vs Zombies. If you ever meet them, thank them. If they ever turn this into a sellable game, do buy it.

Note: This document is by no means official, and is based on my experiences as a player in 5 parties. Since 2010, there have been more than 20 parties that we know of.
